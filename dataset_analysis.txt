# ShanghaiTech Dataset Analysis

## Overview
Dataset downloaded successfully. Contains two parts:
- **Part A**: Congested scenes (likely web images). High density.
- **Part B**: Sparse scenes (surveillance view). Low/Medium density.

## Statistics

### Part A
- **Train Images**: 300
- **Test Images**: 182
- **Annotation Format**: MATLAB (.mat) files with head center points.
- **Average Density (Train)**: ~581 people per image.
- **Image Resolution**: Variable, high resolution.

### Part B
- **Train Images**: 400
- **Test Images**: 316
- **Annotation Format**: MATLAB (.mat) files with head center points.
- **Average Density (Train)**: ~123 people per image (estimated).
- **Image Resolution**: Fixed, 768x1024.

## Notes for Modeling
1. **YOLOv8**: Requires bounding boxes. Since only points are available, we will generate pseudo-bounding boxes of fixed size (e.g., 10% of image height/width or fixed pixel size) around each point.
2. **CSRNet**: Optimized for Part A's high density.
3. **P2PNet**: Should handle both well.

## Usage
- Training will use the combined dataset or separate parts depending on model limitations.
- Validation will use the provided test sets.
